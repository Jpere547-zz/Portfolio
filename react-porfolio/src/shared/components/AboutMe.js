              Hi! Welcome to my personal page. I'm always looking to add more
              skills and experiences to my personal studies and work on research
              papers within the computer science field. I'm very interested in
              the world of Computers and Technology and their hardware. I
              recently earned a Masters of Science in Computer Engineering from
              the University of Central Florida. Current goals include wanting
              to develop my skills as a Computer Engineer into the future of
              technology and advancements in many everyday devices we use. I've
              worked and developed with many of the top computer programming
              languages to expand on my own skills library and apply them to my
              field. From C, C++, Java, JS, Angular, Python, and iOS Development
              with Swift. Working towards being an overall jack of all trades
              within the Computer Science field and be adaptable to any
              programming environment. I'm aiming to further expand my research
              and knowledge in my passion for computer hardware.
